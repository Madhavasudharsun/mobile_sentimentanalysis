Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,MOBGXFXYMTKAMPTS,4,Review after 2 days of usage,"Just got my Motorola Edge 50 Pro from the first flash sale and I've been using it for the past two days. Here's what I found:

Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,MOBGXFXYMTKAMPTS,5,Super!,"Hi all

Got the phone yesterday. I have always tried to use flagship or upper mid tier phones..so Google Nexus 5, Redmi K20 Pro, Samsung 21FE , Realme 11 Pro..etc. This phone is miles above these phones...particularly Samsung 21FE.

Although the chipset is half the Antutu score of a flagship...for day to day use...its super quick...

Camera is also good..except the already reported stutter or slowness which should go away after an update.

Overall...very impressed with the 28K I paid."
Motorola Edge 50 Pro 5G,MOBGXFXYMTKAMPTS,5,Just wow!,"I have been using this phone for 10 days now and I must say it's really mesmerizing.
To start off the cameras are phenomenal..punchy and at the same time not over saturated. Colours and skin tones are on point. The front camera is also promising with high details. The camera app needs some improvement as it feels slow and laggy.
The display is top notch no complaints at all.
Speakers are loud and clear.
Performance for 95% of the time is smooth, only in high graphic games u may notice some f...

Speaking of the display, it accurately reproduces colors; in fact, it matches the color accuracy level of my MacBook display, earning it a 10/10 rating.

SD 8 gen 2 means no issues with performance. Overall a perfect phone for those who are looking to buy a small sized phone which should also be a flagship.

Update after 1 week - Battery is still on the lower end, but that's expected for a phone this small. The AI is still learning the usage patterns so I hope it'll get better."

SAMSUNG Galaxy S23 5G,MOBGMFFX5XYE8MZN,5,Mind-blowing purchase,Very good phone but pricing is a bit higher. Battery backup is above average but samsung needs to improve changing technology. 15w charger takes almost 90 minutes but 25w also takes 75-80 min from 0-100. Camera is awesome. RAM Management is fabulous. Heating issue after some heavy tasks and even after using 10 min of camera app. Samsung needs to fix it with software update.

Pros:
Camera quality is impressive especially Portait mode.. The quality of images are similar to DSLR camera. Phone is smooth and it works like a magic.

Fingerprint doesn't work sometimes.Had to to try multiple times.

You can get around 4 to 5 hours of screen on time and the charging is bit slow. The display is top notch and the camera is also great. But if you come to performance part and if you are performing normal day-to-day task, you will not have any issues. But as soon as you start doing heavy task it will warm up.

Been using this phone for two weeks now. The main highlight of the pixel 8 phone is the camera. To be honest it is undeniably stunning and takes high quality shots especially the night sight. The photo features are amazing. The phone doesn't heat that much as compared to pixel 7 when using the camera app for a longer time, but doesn't necessarily mean it's fixed. Apart from that, there aren't any major lags while using the phone. The display is very nice at 2400 nits peak ...

Motorola Edge 40,MOBGKHNBY3JZJHTB,3,Good choice,"Pros: best design, best hardware, premium feel and looks, catchy display, easy to operate. Not very big for one handed operation, sleek, fits perfectly in the pocket.

Cons: worst battery life, I don't play any heavy games, and use my phone for very basic needs. Still I have to charge the phone twice a day. And the camera is not as expected. I've been using the phone for a month and I've noticed my phone shows some error and goes back to the lock screen. This happened three or four times. And...

Motorola Edge 40,MOBGKHNBY3JZJHTB,5,Wonderful,"Very nice phone, super smooth. Great battery life and charging speed, easily lasting one day with medium usage. Screen and UI is top notch. The front camera just needs some improvement otherwise the phone is awesome."

Motorola Edge 40,MOBGKHNBY3JZJHTB,4,Nice product,Slim and nice pH and osm camera and looking for osm ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Motorola Edge 40,MOBGKHNBY3JZJHTB,4,Pretty good,The phone is slim and light weight. The display is crisp and clear. Battery backup is decent with a massive charger which refills your battery at ultra fast level. The camera performance is decent enough. Overall the stock android and Motorola UI provides a better user experience.
Motorola Edge 40,MOBGKHNBY3JZJHTB,4,Worth the money,"The phone looks good and made me fall in love with the design, slimness and the clean UI.

Camera is a good but not that great, takes good photos and videos with back camera thanks to f1.4 and OIS.

Front camera is bad, it needs light to take good photos. If it is low light recommend not to use front camera.

Display is great, HDR and Dolby sound are a plus for this phone. But take care of screen with protectors.

Battery is the only minus for this phone, needs optimization and it overheats i...

Motorola Edge 40,MOBGKHNBY3JZJHTB,4,Worth the money,"Good to see that MOTOROLA is back.
This Phone is big daddy on 30k price
PRONS.
1) Display is osm and much bright in day light.
2) Look primium in vegan leather specially in green colour.
3) 144hz with Curved display
4) Clear Android experience.
5) Fully charged 0% to 100% in 45 min.(0 to 80 in 30 min)

CONS.
1) Camera quality should be improved.
2) Slightly heating while charging.
3) Display protection should be given min GG 3 or 5.
4) Edge light sometimes not work properly."
Motorola Edge 40,MOBGKHNBY3JZJHTB,4,Value-for-money,"This is an excellent device from Motorola. I replaced the Samsung M51 (7000mah battery) with this mobile so the battery is definitely one area of concern to me. To prevent battery drainage I am using 60hz refresh rate which is equally good to the eyes.The other small issue is the mobile gets a little heated up while charging or heavy usage. Rest all are of excellent quality and can compete with any premium Android mobile phones in the market.This feedback has been provided after 11 days of ex...
